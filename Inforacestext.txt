The race system allows you to add __your__ races to the generator. Each NPC will then be asigned a race as well as a few other feature.

You add a race throufght the @prefix@addfantasyrace [race] [gender=both] [weight=1] command

The race should be given in the singular form and if their is a different version for each gender you can enter them separately with the none gender
 
The gender is separate from the race so you can have races with uneven, no or more then two genders. The none gender will remove gender from the descriptors of NPC of that race.

You must input a gender a gender to input a weight

Each races will appear in numbers proportional to their weight. In the below example list 2/3 of elves will be female and their will be on golem for every 10 humans.

"@prefix@addfantasyrace human" will add two entries to your personal list:
 * human male   0.5
 * human female 0.5

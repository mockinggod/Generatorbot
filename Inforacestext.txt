The race system allows you to add __your__ races to the generator. Each NPC will then be assigned a race and this will affect their names, occupations and other things.

You add a race through the @prefix@addfantasyrace [race] [gender=both] [weight=1] [forename=engm] [surname=engsur] [maxsettlement=5] [occupations=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]] command

Parameters must be inputted in order.

**Race**: (A string) The race should be given in the singular form and if there is a different version for each gender you can enter them separately with the none gender
 
**Gendre**: (A string) The gender is separate from the race so you can have races with uneven, no or more than two genders. The "both" gender will create both genders simultaneously and identically. The "none" gender will remove gender from the descriptors of NPC of that race.

**Weight**: (A number between 0 and 999.999) Each race will appear in numbers proportional to their weight. In the below example list 2/3 of elves will be female and there will be on golem for every 20 humans.

**Forename**: (A string) Will decide the what list the forenames are pulled from or generated from. If gender is both enter an ethnicity otherwise the parameter must be from the name-string list. Type "@prefix@ info names" for more information

**Surname**: (A string) Will decide the what list the surnames are pulled from or generated from. The parameter must be from the name-string list alternatively the "none" surname will deactivate surnames for the races. Type "@prefix@ info names" for more information

**Maxsettlement**: (An integer between -9 and 9.) 
-9: The race builds no settlements and only lives in cities
-8: The race builds no settlements and only lives in towns and cities
-7: The race builds no settlements and only lives in villages and bigger
-6: The race builds no settlements and only lives in hamlets and bigger
-5: The race builds no settlements and lives in any settlements

Races that build settlements can live in any settlement

**Occupations**: (This parameter must be given as 11 numbers separated by "," and boxed in by "[]", no spaces)

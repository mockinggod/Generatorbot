Generatorbot is a tool developed for helping to run rpgs by creating randomly generated prompts. It is intended to be used both as a prep and improve tool. This is an amateur project made for fun.
If you have any questions or feedback you can use the !feedback command alternatively my reddit username is u/mockinggod. You can add the bot at this url: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=539094711105880074&scope=bot&permissions=2048.

If you want the bot to delete the commands after it acts on them, you must manually give it the permission to manage messages.

Generatorbot is a tool developed for helping to run rpgs by creating randomly generated prompts. It is intended to be used both as a prep and improve tool. This is an amateur project made for fun.
If you have any questions or feedback you can use the @prefix@feedback command alternatively my reddit username is u/mockinggod.

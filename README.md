Thank you for your interest in Generatorbot.

This is a discord bot developed to help GMs prepare and run there rpg session by creating randomly generated prompts. Five interconnected prompts are currently available: Names, Books, Missions, NPCs, Inns and Settlements. For now there is only fantasy content.
The philosophy behind this generator is inspired by the tables found in the Forbidden Land rpg.

When an item is generated on a server some of the info will be sent to the same channel, and whoever sends the command will receive a private message with more information such as secrets and details.

The tables are kept in .txt format so that the (even more) laymen can edit them easily

Dependencies:
 * numpy.py
 * titlecase.py
 * discord.py rewrite
 * apscheduler

To run your own version you will need to add three files to the repository:
 * Token.txt with your bots discord token number
 * discordid.txt with your discord id
 * prefixes.txt with "0,!"
 
Current version 0.3.1
